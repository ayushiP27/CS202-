I have implemented player vs player tic-tac-toe game

First it will ask for the name of both players. 

Then player 1 will have chance and it will input the row and column where it wants to enter the symbol 


Then player 2 will have chance and it will input the row and column where it wants to enter the symbol 

I have assigned the symbols for the players already. 

After each turn the game board will be displayed and it will keep on updating after every chance. 

The code has been implemented in such a way that after every turn, it will be checked if any player has won or not, if the board if full or not.

In case the board is full the game will end in a TIE. 

This, is all about the game. 


Coming to the code -

I have created the game board by using array data structure.

Then I have made function for Displaying board and deciding the winners. All the things are mentioned in the code in the form of comments.

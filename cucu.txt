I have made compiler CUCU for a language similar to C that has some features of the C programming language. 

There are four files in total - 

cucu.l - lex file 

cucu.y - yacc file 

sample1.c - correct syntax code 

sample2.c - incorrect syntax code 




INSTRUCTIONS ABOUT HOW TO EXECUTE THE PROGRAM - 

# We will run the lexer file by giving the command - “lex lexer.l”

# First, we will compile our yacc program by using the command - "yacc -v -d parser1.y"

# Now, to generate executable file we will use command - "gcc -ll y.tab.c" 

# Final step is testing our compiler with the help of sample code. Since, I have made compiler for C I will use a basic C program sample1.c 
By using the command - "./a.out<input1.c" we will check our compiler.
